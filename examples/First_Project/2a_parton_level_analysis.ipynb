    "The `sample_benchmark` (or in the case of `run_all`, `sample_benchmarks`) option can be used to specify which benchmark should be used for sampling, i.e. for which benchmark point the phase space is optimized. If you just use one benchmark, reweighting to far-away points in parameter space can lead to large event weights and thus large statistical fluctuations. It is therefore often a good idea to combine a lot of events at the \"reference hypothesis\" (for us the SM) and smaller samples from other benchmarks that span the parameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "One slight annoyance is that MadGraph only supports Python 2. The `run()` and `run_multiple()` commands have a keyword `initial_command` that let you load a virtual environment in which `python` maps to Python 2 (which is what we do below). Alternatively / additionally you can set `python2_override=True`, which calls `python2.7` instead of `python` to start MadGraph."

The transverse momenta of the jets are then derived from the smeared energy and the on-shell condition for the quarks (this is what `pt_resolution_abs=None` does). The photons from the Higgs are assumed to be measured perfectly (otherwise we'd have to call `set_smearing` another time with `pdgis=[22]`)."
